Pathway, module analysis in mummichog;

add pd.dataframe to each class as output format

Will add options of diff algorithms

if input is empCpd data,
test connection patterns of all possible metabolites;
optional: including possible metabolites in metabolic models but not in user supplied annotation

modularity should be updated to more standardized implementation/algorithms

Pathways will consider information/importance of metabolites in pathways;
flux connection

other sets include ontological groups and similarity groups
